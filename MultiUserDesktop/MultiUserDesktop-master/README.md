# MultiUserDesktop
 C# Desktop application based on multi level user login.
 I was thinking how someone can login with a different user roles and can access the relevent functionality 
 So I just start writing this and this thing works to me fine.
 I hard coded the values....actually I was focusing on the actual logic.
 You may retrive the username, password and UserRole values from the Database user table save them into variables and for the rest same logic will work.
